# Disable Resample script for Sony Vegas
Put the files into the Script Menu folder (e.g. `%ProgramFiles%\Sony\Vegas Pro 13.0\Script Menu`).

Restart Sony Vegas or press *Tools>Scripting>Rescan...* to update script list. You should have a new option at *Tools>Scripting>Resample...*.
## Info
If you're using Magix Vegas, then you can go into the *Project Properties* and change the *Resample mode* without needing this script.
